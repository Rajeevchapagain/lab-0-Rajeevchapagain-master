# Lab 0

## Getting Started

## 5 points

This lab serves primarily to ensure that all students can do the following:

* Get assignments from GitHub Classroom
* Run the tests provided with the majority of the labs in the course this semester
* Properly submit the assignments

### Milestones

There are two milestones for this project (and you must have at least one commit for each milestone)

* Adding the required source headers to the source files (2 pts)
* Completing the lab and passing the test distriuted with the project (2 pts)

Note that you may have more than one commit for each milestone.

### Passing the tests

Making the tests pass for this lab is easy; the `bar`method in the file `Foo.java` must return 0 instead of -1.  You should change the method so it accomplishes this task.
